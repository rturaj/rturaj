### Hi, I'm Roman Turaj! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fullstack Developer working mainly in Javascript and less in Typescript. My primary frontend framework is Vue.js, but I'm also able to work with React.js. I'm familiar with state management libraries - Vuex and Redux. I know SSR and frameworks which allow to work with it - Nuxt and Next. I'm fluent with CSS, tools related to it like SCSS or TailwindCSS and UI libraries such as Vuetify and Material UI. I also know basics of 3D rendering in the browsers and Three.js framework.

On the backend I use Node.js and its frameworks - Express.js, Nest.js and Serverless. I know relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and non-relational - MongoDB. To work with them I use ORMs - Sequelize, TypeORM and ODM - Mongoose. I use Jest.js for testing, Git for control version, Swagger for API documentation, Docker for containerization and Jenkins for CD/CI. This is what I can do at the moment - however, my priority is to meet a business needs, so I'm open to learn everything which allows me to achieve that.

I started my profesional career in 2018, when I joined Webwizards - the agency working for the biggest automotive brands like Audi, Volkswagen, Porsche and Skoda. In 2020 I moved to Auroria Diamonds - one of the leading e-commerce jewelers in Poland. I was studing Computing at Poznan University of Technology for 4 years in a weekend mode and I graduaded with a Bachelor of Science degree. I would say my English level is B2/C1, but I never passed any certification which could confirm it.

I love programming and I spend time for learning every day. I would like to work in an international company where I could mature as a programmer and become Senior Developer / Team leader in the future.
