### Hi, I'm Roman Turaj! 👋👋👋

I work as Fullstack Node.js Developer. I'm based in Poznan, Poland 🌇  
My first frontend love is Vue.js and I use it in daily programing. ❤️‍🔥  
I also know basics of React, but I didn't have an oportunity to work with it. 🤔  
On the backend I use Express.js, but recently I discovered Nest.js and it looks promising. 👍  
You can find more about my background on my [![Linkedin](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVE0j.png) LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roman-turaj/) profile
